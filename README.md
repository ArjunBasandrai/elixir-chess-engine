Elixir is a [UCI-compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface) chess engine developed in C++. It is the successor of my previous engine, [Shuffle](https://github.com/ArjunBasandrai/shuffle-chess-engine/), and is under development with the goal of achieving an ELO rating of 3500+.

## Ratings

|   | **CCRL BLitz** | **CCRL 40/15** |
|:-:| :------------: | :------------: |
| **v3.0** | 3564 | 3496 |
| **v2.0** | 3018 | 2938 |
| **v1.0** | 2828 | - |

## Instructions to build
Building Elixir requires `Make` and latest versions of `clang++` or `g++` with `C++20` support
```bash
make CXX=<compiler>
```
- Replace `<compiler>` with your preferred compiler - either `clang++` or `g++`
  - If not specified, the compiler defaults to `clang++`
- Upon successful compilation, the binary file will appear in the root directory as `elixir` or `elixir.exe` depending on your operating system
  - You can also give a custom name to the binary by specifying it as `EXE=<name>` during compilation

Alternatively, you can download pre-compiled binaries from the [Releases](https://github.com/ArjunBasandrai/elixir-chess-engine/releases) page

> [!NOTE]  
> Elixir utilizes a third-party tool - [**INCBIN**](https://github.com/graphitemaster/incbin/blob/main/incbin.h) to embed NNUE weights into the binary. However, **INCBIN** is not fully compatible with `clang++` on `Windows`. If you're using `clang++` to compile Elixir on a `Windows` system, ensure that the `nnue.bin` file is located in the same directory as the compiled binary.

## UCI Options
| Name             |  Type   | Default value |       Valid values        | Description                                                                          |
|:-----------------|:-------:|:-------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Hash`             | integer |      64       |         [4, 1048576]         | Memory allocated to the Transposition Table (in MB).                                 |
| `Threads`          | integer |       1       |             [1, 1024]             | Number of Threads used to search.                                                    |
